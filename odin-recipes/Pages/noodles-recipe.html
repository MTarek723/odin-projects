    <p>This is a great recipe to make any time. Lots of flavor. Top with cilantro and bean sprouts.</p>
    <h3>ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (10 ounce) package fresh udon noodles</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon sesame oil, divided, or to taste</li>
        <li>2 cups chopped broccoli</li>
        <li>½ green bell pepper, cut into matchsticks</li>
        <li>2 small carrots, cut into matchsticks, or to taste</li>
        <li>½ zucchini, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>mayonnaise</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons mirin (Japanese sweet wine)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chili-garlic sauce</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon minced ginger</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook udon in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until noodles are tender yet firm to the bite, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water. Stir in a few drops of sesame oil.</li>
        <li>Heat the remaining sesame oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook broccoli until bright green and still crunchy, about 5 minutes. Add green bell pepper and carrots; cook and stir until slightly softened, about 2 minutes. Add zucchini; cook until slightly softened, about 2 minutes more. Add soy sauce, mirin, chili-garlic sauce, and ginger; stir to combine. Mix in the noodles; cook and stir until noodles absorb some of the sauce, 1 to 2 minutes more.</li>
    </ol>
